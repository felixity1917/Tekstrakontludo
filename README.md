# Tekstrakontludo
Tekstrakontludo is my first take on a short Choices-Driven RPG in Cli mode.

This is also my very first game that I have made on my own.

Tekstrakontludo is an Esperanto word which literally means 'A Text Story Game'.

(This was made as an assignment project in my University (VIT). VIT Registration Number: 24BCE0981)
